# Spring Native Demo Application

A demo application to illustrate how to build and run a Spring Boot application using Spring Native.

## Building

Using Maven, execute the following command to build the native image:
```shell
mvn -Pnative spring-boot:build-image
```

## Running

Once the image is built, you can run it using Docker:

```shell
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 docker.io/library/spring-native-demo:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```

## Testing

Testing out the API is simple using [httpie](https://httpie.io/)!

### Creating a Person
